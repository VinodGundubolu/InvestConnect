I want to build an Investment Relationship Management (IRM) Tool for my organization with the following features and requirements:
1. Two Custom Domains
•	Investor Domain: For investors to log in and securely view their individual investment details only.
•	Admin Domain: For admin users to log in, manage all investors, and enter new investments/investment details.
2. Investor Portal Features
•	Investor only sees their own data:
•	Principal Amount
•	Interest Earned to Date
•	Current Year Interest Rate
•	Maturity Date
•	Debt & Credit (Interest Amounts)
•	Downloadable reports and statements showing the above data.
3. Admin Portal Features
•	Admin can:
•	View all investors and their aggregated investment data.
•	Click into a profile to view a single investor’s details.
•	Add and edit investment details directly from the Admin Portal, including all fields in the provided Excel (Investor Info, Investment Summary, Investment Plan Module, Transaction Summary, Disbursement).
•	System should store all updates in a secure backend/database and instantly reflect them on respective investor/admin dashboards.
4. Backend & Hosting Requirements
•	All investment entries and changes should be saved to a secure backend database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.).
•	Web application should be hosted on a reliable platform (like AWS, Azure, or any other recommended host).
•	Data privacy and access control: Investors cannot see others’ data; only admins have full data visibility and edit rights.
5. Dashboards
•	Dashboards on both portals should be designed as per the attached Excel sheet structure (fields like Investor Info, Investment Summary, Plan details, Transactions, Disbursements, Bonus, etc.).
•	Investors see only their dashboard; Admins see all investors and can select one to view detailed dashboards.
6. Reporting
•	Investors and admins can download detailed investment reports, statements, and transaction history as PDF/Excel.
•	Admins can download overall investment summaries and performance reports.
7. Other Features
•	Auto-generated Investor ID per the formula in the attached Excel sheet (Year, terms version, bond count, Aadhaar digits, and serial number).
•	Secure login system (role-based access: Investor/Admin).
•	User-friendly UI with clear separation of investor and admin functions.

⚡ For the development team or AI assistant:
•	Model the dashboards, data entry forms, and exportable report formats on the attached Excel (“Project_2025.xlsx” – IRM tab).
•	Recommend a hosting solution suitable for production use.
•	Propose a backend system, database schema, and frontend framework (suggested: React/Vue/Angular).
•	Ensure easy scalability and security.

Certainly! Here’s a structured breakdown of the dashboards and their fields based on your attached Excel file (IRM sheet). This covers both the organization and field names for each module/section.

Develop a Returns Calculator for the IRM Tool with the following rules:
1. Dividend Yield:
•	Year 1: 0%
•	Year 2: 6%
•	Year 3: 9%
•	Year 4: 12%
•	Year 5: 18%
•	Years 6–9: 18% each year
•	Year 10: 0% (no interest in this year)
2. Bonus Rules:
•	On completion of Year 5, add a 100% bonus on the original investment amount.
•	On completion of Year 10, add a 100% bonus again on the original investment amount.
3. Interest Calculation:
•	Dividend/interest is always calculated only on the original investment amount, NOT on the bonus or accumulated interest.
•	For Year 10, there is no interest/dividend—only the bonus is added.
4. Functionality:
•	Returns calculator should accept investment date and amount, and auto-calculate yearly yields and applicable bonuses as per above logic.
•	Display breakdown: Year-wise interest, cumulative total, and bonuses applied after 5th and 10th years.
5. Report Output:
•	Annual returns table (Year, Dividend Rate, Dividend Amount)
•	Line showing bonuses added at end of Year 5 and 10
•	Calculation summary: Original amount, total interest/dividends, total bonuses, maturity value
