What This Tool Does
I need to create two seperate URL one for Investor and one for admin where admin can see the overall details like attached and Investor can only see his/her details and whenever we need to provide an option to create investor in the admin portal and this data should sync live and Investor will be created and login credentials will be shared to the investor via email and that investor details should also be updated in the investor portalAn online platform that helps investment companies manage their investors and track investment returns. Think of it as a complete system for handling investor relationships and calculating investment profits.     

Two Different User Types For Individual Investors * Personal login page where investors can see their own investments * Shows how much money they invested and when * Displays current returns and future projections * Shows transaction history (interest payments, bonuses) * Can sign digital investment agreements * Protected - each investor only sees their own data 
For Company Administrators * Master dashboard showing  investors at once * Complete overview of everyone's investments and returns * Can export all investor data to Excel/CSV files * Manages the entire investment portfolio * Handles new investor registrations * Processes transactions and interest payments 
Key Features Built Investment Calculator * Two investment plans: 5-year and 10-year options, I have attached the plans for both 5 year and 10 year and Investor can buy maximum of 3 bonds , each bond value is 20lakhs , maximum an investor can buy 60 lakhs * Shows year-by-year breakdown of interest and bonus payments * Helps investors understand their future returns
 Login System * Multiple ways to log in: email, phone number, username, or investor ID * Automatically creates login credentials for new investors * Secure password system with change options * Different access levels for investors vs administrators 
Data Management * Stores complete investor profiles (names, contacts, investment amounts) * Tracks all investment transactions and interest payments * Records investment start dates and maturity dates * Manages digital agreements and signatures * Exports data exactly matching what's shown on screen 
Business Processes * When someone invests, the system automatically creates their login * Generates legal investment agreements with their details filled in * Calculates and tracks interest payments year by year * Separates regular interest from milestone bonus payments * Provides complete audit trail of all money movements 
What Data It Manages * Investor Information: Names, phone numbers, emails, addresses * Investment Details: How much invested, when, which plan chosen * Financial Tracking: Interest earned, bonuses paid, total returns 
* Legal Documents: Investment agreements with digital signatures * Transaction History: Every payment made to investors with dates

Can you give me the login details
Give me the  login credentials for testing the investment platform: 
I need two seperate portals one for Investor and one for admin like attached so that I can share the Investor URL to investors and when they login with their user name or password, they should see only their details and not other investor details
create two separate portals with distinct URLs - one for investors and one for admins. This will allow you to share the investor URL directly with your investors for secure, personalized access.
