
1.	The 11.6% calculation is mathematically WRONG because:
•	If ₹20L grew at 11.6% for 10 years = ₹59,93,382
•	Actual final value = ₹83,40,000
•	Shortfall = ₹23,46,618
2.	The correct method must use XIRR, not simple CAGR formula
3.	Verification test: At the correct rate, NPV must equal zero

CRITICAL ERROR CORRECTION:
You calculated 11.6% which is wrong. Here's the mathematical proof:

NPV at 11.6% = ₹17,15,689 (should be ₹0)
This proves 11.6% is incorrect.

The correct XIRR is 22.4% because:
- NPV at 22.4% = ₹0 (exactly)
- This accounts for ALL intermediate cash flows
- The 11.6% ignores the timing of cash flows

Please recalculate using Newton-Raphson method to find the rate where NPV = 0.
Expected Correct Output:
•	XIRR: 22.4%


Problem Statement
I have a 10-year debenture investment with the following EXACT cash flows. Please calculate the XIRR (Internal Rate of Return) using the correct mathematical method.
CASH FLOW DATA:
•	Year 0 (Initial): -₹20,00,000 (Investment outflow)
•	Year 1: +₹0
•	Year 2: +₹1,20,000
•	Year 3: +₹1,80,000
•	Year 4: +₹2,40,000
•	Year 5: +₹23,60,000 (₹3,60,000 dividend + ₹20,00,000 bonus)
•	Year 6: +₹3,60,000
•	Year 7: +₹3,60,000
•	Year 8: +₹3,60,000
•	Year 9: +₹3,60,000
•	Year 10: +₹40,00,000 (₹20,00,000 bonus + ₹20,00,000 principal return)
Total final value: ₹83,40,000
REQUIRED CALCULATION:
Please use the XIRR formula: NPV = Σ [CFₜ / (1 + r)ᵗ] = 0
Where you need to find the rate 'r' that makes NPV = 0.
STEP-BY-STEP REQUIREMENTS:
1.	Set up the equation: -20,00,000 + 0/(1+r)¹ + 1,20,000/(1+r)² + 1,80,000/(1+r)³ + ... = 0
2.	Use Newton-Raphson method or similar iterative approach
3.	Show the rate that makes NPV = 0
4.	Verify by calculating NPV at your final rate
IMPORTANT NOTES:
•	Do NOT use simple CAGR formula (Final/Initial)^(1/n) - 1
•	Do NOT ignore intermediate cash flows
•	The answer should be around 22-23%, NOT 11.6%
•	If you get 11.6%, you are using the wrong method
VERIFICATION TEST:
Your final rate should make the NPV extremely close to zero when you calculate:
text
NPV = -20,00,000/(1+r)⁰ + 0/(1+r)¹ + 1,20,000/(1+r)² + 1,80,000/(1+r)³ + 2,40,000/(1+r)⁴ + 23,60,000/(1+r)⁵ + 3,60,000/(1+r)⁶ + 3,60,000/(1+r)⁷ + 3,60,000/(1+r)⁸ + 3,60,000/(1+r)⁹ + 40,00,000/(1+r)¹⁰
DEBUGGING THE 11.6% ERROR:
If you get 11.6%, it's mathematically incorrect. Here's why:
Test: If ₹20L grows at 11.6% for 10 years:
•	Final Value = 20,00,000 × (1.116)^10 = ₹59,93,382
•	But actual final value = ₹83,40,000
•	Difference = ₹23,46,618 (huge shortfall!)
NPV Test at 11.6%:
•	NPV = ₹17,15,689 (NOT zero, so 11.6% is wrong!)
The correct XIRR
